## A History of Infrastructure

Infrastructure has been around for a very long time

# Manual Everything

???
Many years ago, everything as done manually - buy or lease a physical server, get it installed in a datacenter. Provision it by installing the operating system and software/applications needed. Patch and update it by logging in with SSH.

# Basic Automation

Basic automation was achievable through scripting and programming languages like bash and python, but resource utilization was low and costs were high.

# Machine Virtualization

Machine virtualization and hypervisors came along and allowed us to run multiple computers on the same host, increasing resource utilization and decreasing acquisition time

We are currently in the era of container engines and schedulers like docker, nomad, and k8s - tools which allow us to reach close to resource maximization and allow for dynamic scale and isolation.

# Maturity

We have evolved so much since the inception of computers, you would think we have reached zen by now... But in fact, it's incredibly painful.

As we add more and and more functionality (capability), we add more complexity

It turns out that modeling the relationships between these resources is actually very similar to a relational database (the right is an Entity Relationship Diagram)

And we already have techniques for modeling databases as code... so why can't we model infrastructure as code?

# What is Infrastructure as Code?

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the process of managing and provisioning  infrastructure with machine-readable definition files.

---
name: iac-allows-us-to
class: compact
# Infrastructure as Code Allows Us To...

* Provide a codified workflow to create infrastructure
* Change and update existing infrastructure
* Provide reusable modules for easy sharing and collaboration
* Safely test changes using **`terraform plan`** in dry run mode
* Enforce security policy and organizational standards
* Enable collaboration between different teams
* Integrate with application code workflows (Git, CI/CD tools)
???
one of the primary goals of IaC is to provide a repeatable workflow for creating and managing infrastructure.

IaC also provides the ability to safely manage updates to existing infrastructure components.

IaC promises to bring the same tools and techniques of application development (SCM, code review, etc) to infrastructure management.

And lastly, IaC aims to expose ways to share components and separate responsibilities (modules).

# What is Terraform?

* An infrastructure as code tool
* **Executable Documentation**
* Human and machine readable
* Easy to learn
* Test, share, re-use, automate
* Works on all major cloud providers, on premise infrastructure (VMware, Cisco, Palo Alto, F5, etc.), SaaS applications (DataDog, Okta, etc.), and 300+ more.

# Terraform OSS
- Terraform is an open source infrastructure as code provisioning tool.
<br>
- It is a single cross platform binary written in Go. It can run on Linux, Windows, or OS X.
<br>
- Installing Terraform is easy. You simply download a zip file, unzip it, and run it. Terraform OSS works with files in a directory.

- Manages Terraform runs in a consistent and reliable environment
- Includes easy access to shared state and secret data
- Has a robust Role Based Access system
  * Plan
  * Approve
  * Write
- Includes a private registry for sharing Terraform modules

# Terraform vs. Other Tools

Terraform is a Declarative Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool.  

This means that you declare what you want the state of the world but not the how of doing that.

Imperative tools such as Ansible or AWS CLI require that you build logic to ensure the state of the world matches your desired state.  

These tools are ideal for Day 2 operations or variable changes that may need to be adjusted inconsistently between systems or applications after Terraform establishes the state of the world.

???
Good discussion points here to bring up the Better Together story around Terraform with operational tools such as Ansible or Chef.
Get information on what tools they may be using and how they are using them for where Terraform may be a good IaC fit.

# What is a Version Control System (VCS)?

![:scale 70%](../images/distributed_vcs.png)

Version control systems are applications that allow users to store, track, test, and collaborate on changes to their infrastructure and applications.

Terraform Cloud integrates with many common Version Control Systems.

# VCS Integration with Terraform Cloud

![:scale 70%](../images/git_noobs.png)

Terraform Cloud can directly integrate with source code repos in GitHub, Gitlab, Azure DevOps, and Bitbucket. This allows you to build simple DevOps workflows with code reviews, testing and approvals.

https://xkcd.com/1597/

???
**If you've never used git before, don't worry. We are only going to be using four or five basic commands. And as our friends at XKCD have pointed out, you can always wipe everything clean and clone a fresh copy of the code. We will be using version control in our lab but will use the web based user interface**

---
name: multi-user-collaboration
class: compact
# User Collaboration
Users from different teams or departments can all benefit from centralized infrastructure as code.

Infrastructure changes are no longer created in isolated silos.

Each team can contribute or consume Terraform code according to their needs.

???
**When you store all your terraform code in git repos, you unlock some extra features like user collaboration. Terraform Cloud helps bring these teams closer in a more productive way.**

---
name: vcs-driven-workflow
# Automated Test Pipelines
.center[![:scale 60%](../images/git_workflow_tests.png)]

When your Terraform code is stored in a version control system, you unlock extra features like pull requests, code reviews and testing. Here's an example showing some tests that run on our training lab repo.

???
**Storing your code in VCS also enables you to build automated test pipelines and conduct code reviews to approve any pending changes. Multiple users can build and contribute changes to the same infrastructure as code base without stepping on one another's toes.**

---
name: everything-is-recorded
# No More Untracked Changes
.center[![:scale 100%](../images/git_commit_log.png)]

Every infrastructure change is recorded and tracked in the git log. You will always know exactly who made a change, what was changed, who approved the change, and when and why the change was made.

???
**Your auditors and security folks will like this because every change is tracked. No more mystery changes or wondering if something broke because of an untracked change.**
